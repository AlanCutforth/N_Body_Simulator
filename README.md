# N_Body_Simulator
 
Code written to simulate n astronomical bodies as per Newton's laws of gravitation for my final Scientific Computing project. For my investigation, I chose to observe the effect of a rogue flyby on the orbits of the Earth and the Moon.

nbody_simulator:
The simulator without the investigation, configured to simulate the solar system.

nbody_flyby_star_investigation:
The simulator configured to perform the flyby star investigation and plot the required graphs.
