# N_Body_Simulator
 
Code written to simulate n astronomical bodies as per Newton's laws of gravitation for my final Scientific Computing project. For my investigation, I chose to observe the effect of a rogue flyby on the orbits of the Earth and the Moon.

nbody_simulator.py:
The simulator without the investigation, configured to simulate the solar system.

nbody_flyby_star_investigation.py:
The simulator configured to perform the flyby star investigation and plot the required graphs.

nbodyfigures.pdf:
The graphs and figures plotted to prove that the simulator functions correctly as well as information about the investigation performed.
